Parsing is working by searching a text file for 'Colas', then splitting found lines.
  Got all of the array indices figured for the creation of objects.

Forget about databases;
Start thinking about the creation of objects.

Need to make constructors, setters and getters for Product, User, Store and Order classes.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Started thinking about flow control and the creation of objects.
  - User
    Created upon coming to the site for the first time.
    Will be necessary to use the site.
  - Store
    Will be created if the user enters a store number that has not entered before.
    Upon creation the user will need to upload the 3 previous weeks for
      consolidated inventory usage to set up sales projections.
    Each store will likely need it's own directory to store the consolidated
      inventory usage files.
  - Product
    All will be created when the text file is parsed.

Parsing is working by searching a text file for 'Colas', then splitting found lines.
  Got all of the array indices figured for the creation of objects.

Got constructor, setters and getters made for Product.

Need to make constructors, setters and getters for User, Store and Order classes.

Started thinking about flow control and the creation of objects.

Coming to the site for the first time:

signup (creates user and/or store information, storing the form information in a text file and creating directories for each store, and placing their files accordingly.)
=>
order page (The form will have been filled out with the information provided from the upload.)


Coming back to the site once you've created an account:

login (Checks the login form against the data stored in the text files.)
=>
update/upload (Form to prompt the user for inventory, or giving them the option to upload.)
=>
order page (The form will have been filled out with the information provided from the form or upload.)


  - User
    Created upon coming to the site for the first time.
    Use a text file to store the input information from the form in place of a database for now.
    Will be necessary for logging in and using the site.

  - Store
    Will be created if the user enters a store number that has not entered before.
    Upon creation the user will need to upload the 3 previous weeks for
      consolidated inventory usage to set up sales projections.
    Each store will likely need it's own directory to store the consolidated
      inventory usage files.

Refine order equation for projecting sales. (calculations.php)
  created pseudo code for calculations, just need to go through and implement.

Get upload working to store data in correct directory.

Get Coke's holidays list to configure email.

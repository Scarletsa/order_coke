Parsing is working by searching a text file for 'Colas', then splitting found lines.
  Got all of the array indices figured for the creation of objects.

Got constructor, setters and getters made for Product.

Need to make constructors, setters and getters for User, Store and Order classes.

Started thinking about flow control and the creation of objects.
  - User
    Created upon coming to the site for the first time.
    Will be necessary to use the site.
  - Store
    Will be created if the user enters a store number that has not entered before.
    Upon creation the user will need to upload the 3 previous weeks for
      consolidated inventory usage to set up sales projections.
    Each store will likely need it's own directory to store the consolidated
      inventory usage files.

Refine order equation for projecting sales. (calculations.php)

Get upload working to store data in correct directory.

Get Coke's holidays list to configure email.
